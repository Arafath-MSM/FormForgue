# Simple Form Builder Setup Guide

## 🎯 Current Status
Your SQLite setup is already working! You have:
- ✅ Database created
- ✅ All migrations run
- ✅ Sample data seeded
- ✅ API endpoints ready

## 🚀 Quick Test

### 1. Start Laravel Server
```bash
cd backend
php artisan serve
```

### 2. Test API Endpoints
Open these URLs in your browser:

- **Get all forms:** `http://localhost:8000/api/forms`
- **Get specific form:** `http://localhost:8000/api/forms/1`
- **Get form submissions:** `http://localhost:8000/api/forms/1/submissions`

### 3. Start React Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📊 What You Should See

### API Response (`/api/forms`):
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Contact Form",
    "description": "Get in touch with us",
    "fields": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "label": "Full Name",
        "type": "text",
        "required": true,
        "order": 1
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "label": "Email Address", 
        "type": "text",
        "required": true,
        "order": 2
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "label": "Message",
        "type": "textarea",
        "required": true,
        "order": 3
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Event Registration",
    "description": "Registration form for upcoming events",
    "fields": [...]
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "title": "Product Feedback", 
    "description": "Share your thoughts about our products",
    "fields": [...]
  }
]
```

## 🔧 If You Want MySQL Instead

### 1. Create MySQL Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE form_builder;
```

### 2. Create .env File
```env
APP_NAME=FormBuilder
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=form_builder
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

SESSION_DRIVER=file
SESSION_LIFETIME=120
```

### 3. Run Commands
```bash
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
php artisan serve
```

## 🎉 Your Form Builder is Ready!

### What's Working:
- ✅ **3 Sample Forms** (Contact, Event Registration, Product Feedback)
- ✅ **All Field Types** (Text, Textarea, Radio, Checkbox)
- ✅ **Form Submissions** with validation
- ✅ **RESTful API** for all operations
- ✅ **React Frontend** ready to connect

### Next Steps:
1. **Test the API** endpoints
2. **Start your React app** 
3. **Connect frontend to backend**
4. **Test form creation, editing, and submissions**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Empty Page at Root URL
- Root URL (`http://localhost:8000/`) is for Inertia.js SPA
- Your API works at `/api/forms`
- Connect your React app to the API

### PHP Version Issues
- Your current setup works with SQLite
- No need to upgrade PHP for this project
- SQLite is perfect for development and testing

### Database Issues
- SQLite file: `backend/database/database.sqlite`
- All tables and data are already created
- Ready to use immediately

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Use your current SQLite setup!** It's working perfectly and has:
- All forms created
- All migrations run
- Sample data seeded
- API endpoints ready

Just start the server and test the API endpoints!
